Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
The project is based on building a chatbot using artificial intelligence that takes the input of the user and provides required output. The project is completed using IBM cloud and its services. The dataset used is ecobee3_user guide that is used to train the bot.

The repository contains the watson assistant skill, node-red flow, cloud function and the dataset used(ecobee3_userguide). The earlier chatbot only responds to simple questions such as locations, timings, etc., but this chatbot is integrated with smart understanding and is able to respond to the technical questions related to the device. The various services used to make it are IBM cloud, watson assistant, node-red, discovery.

In this bot if the customer asks a question about the operation of the device, it responds by taking the important information from the manual uploaded as a dataset to train it.
